## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can result in a `broken pipe' condition.
ab=t
# Question 'ac': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can be used to receive data from sockets.
ac=t
# Question 'ad': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language restricts the permissions of a network socket
ad=f
# Question 'ae': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language allows setting the destination address when writing to connection-less sockets.
ae=f
# Question 'af': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language performs the same function as write(), but without the possibility to set flags.
af=t
# Question 'ag': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language requires a network address, to be able to create a socket.
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language can be called by either the initiator or receiver of a socket connection.
ah=f
# Question 'ai': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language closes a server's socket and all open connections created by that socket.
ai=f
# Question 'aj': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language is used to write the address information into a socket.
aj=t
# Question 'ak': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language is used by a server to connect to a client
ak=t
# Question 'al': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language connects a network address to a network address
al=f
# Question 'am': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language can create sockets for various network protocols.
am=t
# Question 'an': True or false: A network socket includes port numbers as well as IP addresses
an=t
# Question 'ao': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language marks a socket as `passive', ready to accept new connections.
ao=t
# Question 'ap': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3, but not layer 4
