## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can result in a `broken pipe' condition.
ab=
# Question 'ac': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can be used to receive data from sockets.
ac=

ad=
# Question 'ae': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language allows setting the destination address when writing to connection-less sockets.
ae=
# Question 'af': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language performs the same function as write(), but without the possibility to set flags.
af=
# Question 'ag': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language requires a network address, to be able to create a socket.
ag=
# Question 'ah': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language can be called by either the initiator or receiver of a socket connection.
ah=
# Question 'ai': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language closes a server's socket and all open connections created by that socket.

an=
# Question 'ao': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language marks a socket as `passive', ready to accept new connections.
ao=
# Question 'ap': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3, but not layer 4
